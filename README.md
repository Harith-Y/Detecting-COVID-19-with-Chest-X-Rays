Detecting COVID-19 with Chest X-Ray using Transfer Learning in PyTorch
The dataset is from Kaggle. (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tawsifurrahman/covid19-radiography-database)

In this project, a RESNET18 model is used and trained.

This project cannot be used to diagnose COVID-19. 
This model cannot be used as is for any real-world application (Also, the dataset is quite limited), i.e. to diagnose COVID-19. A diagnosis is something only a trained medical professional can do. 
This project provides insight into image classification and its application in medical imaging as well.
